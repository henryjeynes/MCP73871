# MCP73871
A breakout board for the MCP73871 battery charger IC from Microchip. Includes circuitry for load sharing, temperature protection, and indicator LEDs.

If you use the resistor values in the schematic (setting the charge current to 1A), be warned that the chip will dissipate up to 3.5 watts. A larger heatsink with or without a fan is mandatory.
